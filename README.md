# Iris Flower Classification
=====================================================

## Introduction
The Iris dataset is a classic problem in machine learning, where the goal is to classify iris flowers into one of three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on their physical characteristics. The dataset contains 150 samples from each of the three species, with 5 features each.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify iris flowers into their respective species based on their physical characteristics. This project aims to explore the importance of different features in classification and to evaluate the performance of various machine learning algorithms on this task.

## Dataset
### Features
The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which contains the following features:

* **Sepal length** (cm)
* **Sepal width** (cm)
* **Petal length** (cm)
* **Petal width** (cm)
* **Species** (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica)

## Model
The model developed in this project uses **Logistic Regression**. The model is trained on the Iris dataset and evaluated using various performance metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.

## Results
The results of the project are presented using:

* **Accuracy score**
* **Confusion matrix**
* **Classification report**

The model's performance is evaluated on a test set and the results are compared with baseline models.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on their physical characteristics. The results show that the model achieves a high accuracy. This project provides a starting point for further exploration of the Iris dataset and the development of more advanced machine learning models.
