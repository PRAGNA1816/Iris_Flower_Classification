# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains two machine learning projects:

### Project 1: Iris Flower Classification

The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: serosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements. The objective of this project is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species.

Using the Iris dataset, I developed a model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. This dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks.

### Project 2: Titanic Survival Prediction

The goal of this project is to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data.

The dataset used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived. I used this data to train a model that can predict the likelihood of survival for a given passenger.

Both projects demonstrate my skills in machine learning and data analysis, and showcase my ability to work with different datasets and algorithms to achieve accurate predictions.
