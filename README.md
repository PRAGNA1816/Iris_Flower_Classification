### Iris Flower Classification

The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: serosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements. The objective of this project is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species.

Using the Iris dataset, I developed a model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. This dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks.
